# PolkadotHub Courses Documentation

This repository contains the source code for the PolkadotHub courses. The course outlines and resources are publicly available and will remain so. Guided instances of the courses will be held throughout the year to provide a more structured learning experience, although the courses can also be taken at a self-paced pace.

## Courses

- Rust Programming Language Course
- Ink! Smart Contract Development Course
- Substrate Development Course

## Run Locally

This project is based on [Astro](https://astro.build/). Before running the project locally, ensure that you have installed the version of Node.js present in the `.node-version` file.

Clone the repository to your local machine and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PolkadotHub/course-docs.git
cd course-docs
yarn
```

Run the project locally by executing the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start a local development server at http://127.0.0.1:3000/ which you can access through your browser. Remember to add the course name to the URL to access the course (e.g. `/substrate`).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged, especially from students of the course who have suggestions or improvements.

If you have any questions, please ask them in the [PolkadotHub Discord](https://discord.gg/ukp6jD6gsT).
