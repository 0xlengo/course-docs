# PolkadotHub Courses Documentation

This repository contains the source code for the PolkadotHub courses. The course outlines and resources are publicly available and will remain so. Guided instances of the courses will be held throughout the year to provide a more structured learning experience, although the courses can also be taken at a self-paced pace.

## Courses

- Rust Programming Language Course
- Ink! Smart Contract Development Course
- Substrate Development Course

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged, especially from students of the course who have suggestions or improvements.

If you have any questions, please ask them in the [PolkadotHub Discord](https://discord.gg/ukp6jD6gsT).
